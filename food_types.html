    <h1>Food Types</h1>
    
    <p>One of the more interesting (and difficult) parts of caring for slimes is knowing how to manage their dietary needs. 
      Most slime types have only one category of food they can eat: meat, vegetables or fruit. And each slime type has its favorite type 
      which will produce twice as many plorts as usual. For instance, Cotton Slimes favorite food is water lettuce.</p>
    
    <p>Though, as with most parts of this game, there are exceptions to the rule. Pink slimes and Ringtail slimes can both eat any type of food, 
      but the downside of that is they don't have a favorite food. Also, slime hybrids can eat the categories of both of their types, so if you feed a difficult slime a 
      pink plort, they can eat whatever! Meanwhile, the new Flutter slimes come with their own new category: Moondew Nectar, 
      but that's all they can eat and it's their favorite food. However, since the game is early release, you can't yet grow the nectar on your own. 
      You have to gather it all in the wild in order to feed your flutter slimes.</p>
