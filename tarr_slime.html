    <h1>Tarr Slimes</h1>
    
    <p>One of the challenges of gathering slimes, especially at night, is Tarr Slimes. Tarr slimes, or tarrs, are amalgamations of several types 
      of slimes. A slime can gain one extra type by eating a plort, but if a slime that already has 2 types eats another plort of a different type, 
      it will turn into a tarr and begin to eat the slimes around it. It will also attack the player if nearby and their numbers can multiply fast. 
      Tarrs can only be stopped by throwing them into water, or shooting them with the water gun gadget. The gadget requires a lot of materials though, 
      so throwing tarrs into the ocean is often your best bet.</p>
