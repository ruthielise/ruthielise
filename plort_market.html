    <h1>The Plort Market</h1>
    
    <p>To start off, what is a plort? Well, it's a byproduct of slimes! The slimes 
      eat food, and then create plorts, which can be used to make gadgets, breed slimes or to sell for money. 
      It's important to understand how the Plort Market operates so you can maximize your profits as a rancher.</p>
    
    <p> First off, the Plort Market operates very similarly to a stock market. The prices rise and fall in a seemingly random way from day to day, 
      but there are ways that you as the player can affect the market. Like if you sell a lot of pink plorts, the price will go down for that specific plort 
      because you have met the demand that created the price. This can happen with any plort no matter how rare, and the prices can even change within the day as well, 
      so it's important to keep an eye on how much everything is worth to make sure you don't erase demand.</p>
