      Hello! My name is Elise and this is my midterm project. I am not entirely sure what to put in this webpage,
      so I will be writing about my new favorite game: Slime Rancher 2!
    </h1>

    <p>Slime Rancher is a sequel to/expansion of the original game Slime Rancher, 
    which is about a woman who goes into the undocumented "Far, Far Range" to gather and farm slimes! 
    There are many things you can do in the game, such as:"</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Gather Slimes</li>
      <li>Breed Slimes</li>
      <li>Sell Plorts</li>
      <li>Explore the Far, Far Range</li>
      <li>Build Gadgets</li>
      <li><em>And More!</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>There are a few things you must know before you can jump in though! For instance, 
    the plorts you need to sell come from feeding slimes and harvesting what they leave behind.
    Other notable topics are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="plort_market">The Plort Market</a></li>
      <li><a href="tarr_slime.html">Tarr Slimes</a></li>
      <li><a href="food_types.html">Food Types</a></li>
      <li><a href="special_requirements.html">Special Requirements</a></li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>But really you can start whenever you want, and you can learn everything
    you need to know while playing the game. And that way, you can also enjoy the improved 
    graphics and movement that come with <strong>Slime Rancher 2!</strong></p>
