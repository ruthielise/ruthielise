  <h1>Special Requirements</h1>
  
  <p>Some slimes have certain requirements that must be met for them to thrive in captivity. 
    For instance, water and fire slimes cannot survive outside of pools of water or fire respectively and they will die after 
    a short amount of time if they are not in those areas. Batty and Phosphor slimes must also be kept in pens that block the suns light, 
    or they will perish as well. Many other slimes also need to be kept in pens with roofs so that they cannot jump out whenever they want.</p>
